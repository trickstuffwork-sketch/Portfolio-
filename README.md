Trickstuff — Fixed site (root layout)

Files included in this ZIP (placed at repo root):
- index.html  (references hero.mp4 and images in repository root)
- styles.css
- script.js
- hero.mp4  (your uploaded MP4)
- profile.jpg, bonker.jpg, xyxxcrew.jpg, aditya.jpg, easybuy.jpg, aurus.jpg, parthiv.jpg, rollingloud.jpg

Important notes:
- GitHub Pages serves files from your repo root if you select the root. This ZIP places all assets at the root to match your uploaded repo structure.
- If thumbnails or hero show as black or a broken icon on GitHub Pages, common causes:
  1) File didn't finish uploading or is missing (check repo file list). 2) Filename mismatch (index.html references 'bonker.jpg' but the repo file is named 'Bonker.JPG' or inside a folder). Filenames are case-sensitive on GitHub Pages. 3) The browser cached an older version — try hard refresh or open an incognito tab. 4) Large MP4 may take time to process — compress to ~5–8MB if possible.
- If any files were missing during ZIP creation, they are listed below.

Files copied into ZIP root:
hero.mp4, profile.jpg, bonker.jpg, xyxxcrew.jpg, aditya.jpg, easybuy.jpg, aurus.jpg, parthiv.jpg, rollingloud.jpg

Missing source files (not found on server when building this ZIP):
None

How to use:
1. Unzip and push these files to your repository root (not a subfolder). 2. In GitHub > Settings > Pages, set Source to main branch and root (/). 3. Wait 30–60 seconds and open your site URL. Hard-refresh if needed (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R).

If you still see a black area where the video or thumbnail should be, tell me the exact filename list from your GitHub repo (screenshot or copy) and I will update index.html to match exact filenames & cases.
